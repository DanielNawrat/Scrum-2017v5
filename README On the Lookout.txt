On the Lookout - A Space Quest

written by Daniel, Tim, Franzsika, Kevin and Tobias.

// Story
Axesto, a bumbling little alien, is cast out from his home planet Fidartis for his ill behaviour. Subsequently, he drifts through space, looking for a new home, but getting
into all kinds of space trouble in the process.


// Instructions
If you want to play the game on your desktop (advised), please download one of the interpreters for your system (e.g. Windows Glulxe) and download the Story File.
Once the game has started you can always use the built-in helper command by simply typing "helper" and you will receive a list of useful commands that can be used to progress the story.


// Save, Quit and Restart
You can also "save", "quit" and "restart" the game at any given time by typing the corresponding phrase and confirming your decision with "yes".

//Teleportation
There is also a teleportation command built in that allows you to teleport to any given planet within the game. All you have to do is type "teleport to [name of the planet]”.
However, it is not recommended to do so since you might miss important parts of the story and therefore might not experience the game in its entirety.

Enjoy the game!
