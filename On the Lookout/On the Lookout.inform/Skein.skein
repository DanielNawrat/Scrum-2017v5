The Flat Rock&#x000A;You arrive on a planet called Sitis. You think the landing went great but as you leave your spaceship, you realise that two of your three water container broke down.

Maybe someones living there who could help you?&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">The Wide Desert&#x000A;You've reached the Desert of Sitis. It gives you two things: First, an impression of what whole Sitis looks like - sandy, dry, with some deep stone canyons and huge rocks afar. But although this planet does not seem to be a place to life, the Desert also gives you the chance to discern that you are not alone. There IS life! When you look north, directly in front of you is a long corrugated iron bridge, guiding over one of those ravines. You can not access the bridge, it is blocked with a barbed wire fence, but straight ahead, at the end you see a majestic sandstone palace. In the bridge's middel, a wooden ladder leads to an enormous square block in the east. Likewise it is built out of stone and gives a somber impression. If you look east from the point you are standing at right now, you see the kind of a rock mine. In the south you recognise a lot of small white houses surrounded by a rampart. It seems like people are living here.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Spaceship Exit&#x000A;Bye Spaceship. Let's go and have a look around. There's more to this planet than ash clouds, lava and rocky landscape if you use your knowledge and cleverness. On the western side you see massives waves detonating on the shores. You turn around and you see a vastland of volcanoes, mountains and dry land. This must be the vast landscape of Geysiria. First I try to explain the map a little - sorry, I don't know everything, but I think I can give you some hints I know from King Kamehameha. Here are your options, respectively the options I know: On the horizon, in the east, there is your landing zone, where you normally land. You landed a little more west on a steep cliff but you were lucky, the spaceship is still in one piece. Here you can either head north on the Kamehameha Route to the North Shore to hopefully reach the big area where all the infamous geysirs are. Your second option is heading towards the little village which is in the eastern part of the planet. You can explore the region of all the volcanoes here. To this point I don't know much more. Keep me updated and I will try and connect the dots at the next stops.&#x000A;&#x000A;Head east to leave the spaceship.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Spaceship Exit&#x000A;Bye Spaceship. Let's go and have a look around. There's more to this planet than ash clouds, lava and rocky landscape if you use your knowledge and cleverness. On the western side you see massives waves detonating on the shores. You turn around and you see a vastland of volcanoes, mountains and dry land. This must be the vast landscape of Geysiria. First I try to explain the map a little - sorry, I don't know everything, but I think I can give you some hints I know from King Kamehameha. Here are your options, respectively the options I know: On the horizon, in the east, there is your landing zone, where you normally land. You landed a little more west on a steep cliff but you were lucky, the spaceship is still in one piece. Here you can either head north on the Kamehameha Route to the North Shore to hopefully reach the big area where all the infamous geysirs are. Your second option is heading towards the little village which is in the eastern part of the planet. You can explore the region of all the volcanoes here. To this point I don't know much more. Keep me updated and I will try and connect the dots at the next stops.&#x000A;&#x000A;Head east to leave the spaceship.&#x000A;&#x000A;&gt;</result>

Many thousand years ago this little town used was rich because of a gold rush. It only took a few years until the little village turned into a ghost town as the gold rush didn't take very long. You have many houses you can look into and search for some hints in order to leave this planet as soon as possible. Stroll around, here are a few spots you should definitely check out. There is an interesting old building right next to the big market place - you will probably need a special key to open the doors there... Around the place there are lots of other buildings, the house of the mayor with a huge amount of old files and many hidden treasure boxes, a little hut where they used to sell Galaxy Coke and a little chapel which kind of looks a bit intimidating.&#x000A;&#x000A;You are situated in the centre of Lihue. You can head into each direction. The volcano is in north east from where you are at the moment. Every other part of Lihue is somewhere around you.

No one knows why, maybe they explain the gold rush where people from all over the galaxy flocked to this particular place. Some seemed to be very religious and brought some belongings along with them. The ceiling is a little bit demolished but the chapel as a whole doesn't look too bad actually. It's quite an intimidating place because there is not a soul in sight and the pictures on the wall have angry faces everywhere. In the corner where the confessional box is there is an arsenal of a few old weapons including swords and a dagger. The dagger might help you as it has a volcano engraved. The coffin under the altar contains something you will need for sure. Somewhere in the little Village there is a hidden key for that particular coffin. Go search for that key and come back later.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;In the south you'll find the house where the Mayor used to politically tie the ropes for Lihue.
