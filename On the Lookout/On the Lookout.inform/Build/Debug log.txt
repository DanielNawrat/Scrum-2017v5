      >--> The sentence 'The room-illustration of the Agora_Sitis is the figure of
        the Agora-Sitis' (source text, line 207) appears to say two things are the
        same - I am reading 'room-illustration of the Agora_Sitis' and 'figure of
        the Agora-Sitis' as two different things, and therefore it makes no sense
        to say that one is the other: it would be like saying that 'John is Paul'.
        It would be all right if the second thing were the name of a kind, perhaps
        with properties: for instance 'Abbey Road is a lighted room' says that
        something called Abbey Road exists and that it is a 'room', which is a kind
        I know about, combined with a property called 'lighted' which I also know
        about.
