Consequently, dividing it between everyone and relinquishing, when someone else still got no water, was taken for granted. Except for Scorpius. He refused to share his water and started to manipulate other ones to do the same. This reckless behaviour culminates in his decision to construct an underground system which blocks all of our water sources, so we can not draw on them anymore. The only one that still gave water, was the one in his new built palace, deep in the north. There was and there is no chance to burgle. His guardians are doing their job very well. Since that day, he comes to Siccum every week and forces us to fight for our water. If you win, you will get two full kegs of water. If you lose... you have to survive one week without new water.
