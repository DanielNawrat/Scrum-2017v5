Without this tool you are pretty much lost and won't be able to leave this planet as you have to stop the huge ash cloud and geysir fountains. The map will help you get to the location where you'll be able to stop pretty much every action going on here on this vast planet. But be careful - don't lose it and read the instructions carefully, as you don't have second chances here.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Spaceship Exit_Geysiria is a room.</p><p class="indent0">The printed name of the Spaceship Exit_Geysiria is &quot;<span class="quote">Spaceship Exit</span>&quot;. The description is &quot;<span class="quote">Bye Spaceship. Let's go and have a look around. There's more to this planet than ash clouds, lava and rocky landscape if you use your knowledge and cleverness. On the western side you see massives waves detonating on the shores. You turn around and you see a vastland of volcanoes, mountains and dry land. This must be the vast landscape of Geysiria. First I try to explain the map a little - sorry, I don't know everything, but I think I can give you some hints I know from King Kamehameha. Here are your options, respectively the options I know: On the horizon, in the east, there is your landing zone, where you normally land. You landed a little more west on a steep cliff but you were lucky, the spaceship is still in one piece. Here you can either head north on the Kamehameha Route to the North Shore to hopefully reach the big area where all the infamous geysirs are. Your second option is heading towards the little village which is in the eastern part of the planet. You can explore the region of all the volcanoes here. To this point I don't know much more. Keep me updated and I will try and connect the dots at the next stops.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Head [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]east[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] to leave the spaceship.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">After taking underwater system map: </p><p class="indent1">remove encryptionkey from play.</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going nowhere from the Spaceship_Geysiria, say &quot;<span class="quote">The key to leave the spaceship is going south. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">If you stand in the exit already - you will need to head [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]east[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] as you stand on the edge of cliff where only going east will make sense.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going south from the Landing Zone_Geysiria, say &quot;<span class="quote">A massive crater is in front of you.
