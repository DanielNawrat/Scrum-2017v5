You have many houses you can look into and search for some hints in order to leave this planet as soon as possible. Stroll around, here are a few spots you should definitely check out. There is an interesting old building right next to the big market place - you will probably need a special key to open the doors there... Around the place there are lots of other buildings, the house of the mayor with a huge amount of old files and many hidden treasure boxes, a little hut where they used to sell Galaxy Coke and a little chapel which kind of looks a bit intimidating.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You are situated in the centre of Lihue.

It's quite an intimidating place because there is not a soul in sight and the pictures on the wall have angry faces everywhere. In the corner where the confessional box is there is an arsenal of a few old weapons including swords and a dagger. The dagger might help you as it has a volcano engraved. The coffin under the altar contains something you will need for sure. Somewhere in the little Village there is a hidden key for that particular coffin.

He quickly became a millionaire but was shot in a fight with one of the gangs who tried to control the gold rush.

This planet is not known to produce the best technology. So you better try to land safely on Frizza. This turns out to be an extreme adventure as you end up in a massive thunderstorm. But that's not a problemm for you - you are the most experienced spaceship commander in the whole galaxy. Without any noise you land smoothly on Frizza.
