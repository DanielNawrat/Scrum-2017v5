A century ago King Kamehameha ventured along this very tiny path you can barely see anymore. He made this entire path for about two hundred kilometers until Hale'iwa, a little spot on the northern Shores of Geysiria. This little spot is called after a bird that is living there. It is a little outlook nestled in a vast land where you can overlook the whole North Shore. The windward west side, the eastern side where many land mines lay below the ground and the ocean is what you can see here. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Three options: head [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]south[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">], back to the Landing Zone. Hike [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]north[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] on the trail towards the Geysirs.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The waterkey is an object. </p><p class="indent0">The waterkey is in the Seaside.</p><p class="indent0">The waterkey can be taken.</p><p class="indent0">After examining the waterkey:</p><p class="indent1"> say &quot;<span class="quote">I can't read it very well... MAG...IC... HOLE? Is it hole or is it mole? I don't know. Anyway, take this thing - you have enough space in your backpack, Axesto.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The description of the Seaside is &quot;<span class="quote">The final point where King Kamehameha landed back when you weren't existing. This is actually the last location where King Kamehameha was known to be alive. He built his Ho'kulea and set sail to reach another planet. His return to his home planet should be very soon but he never came back. By the looks of the ocean I'm not too sure if he made it behind the outer reefs. It is a very dangerous place and I recommend to stay out of the water. Or are you keen enough to set sail to the next planet? I don't think so.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You are in the far north of Geysiria. Actually, the most northern point on the planet. Beautiful views into the galaxy. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">You can either head back [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]south[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] in order to go another way or you head [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]east[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] towards the geysirs which gave the planet its name.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The description of the Geysir_Area is &quot;<span class="quote">Whooooosh, whoooosh - Geysirs everywhere. Massive chambers of lava stone push enormous water massses into the air - what a breathtaking phenomenon! You have been hiking for hours with only a few liters of fresh water. The way was very long and hard, the dangers of falling and getting caught by monstrous waves were contstant. But you made it. Congratulations. So what next? First, you should drink as much as you can, some Geysirs here have fresh drinking water, some are saltwater. You will find out pretty quickly. Now it's time to to get serious. How long can you rest on this planet? Think quick and choose your options wisely. Did you find the underwater map of the underwater volcano system in the spaceship? If yes, you will find the heart of the volcano with the help of this map. Otherwise, you will have to choose another option...</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">In between all the geysirs you see a little hole which has a little sign on it saying MAGIC HOLE.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The Magic Hole is door. </p><p class="indent0">It is fixed in place.</p><p class="indent0">The Magic Hole is locked. </p><p class="indent0">The waterkey unlocks The Magic Hole.</p><p class="indent0">The Magic Hole is openable.</p><p class="indent0">After examining the Magic Hole:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">The only entrance from the geysirs to the caves below surface. </span></p><p class="indent1"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]Try your luck and take the tiny steps down into the cave.[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] You will be rewarded - I promise.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent1"></p><p class="indent0">The Magic Hole is south of the Geysir_Area.</p><p class="indent0">The waterdagger is an object.</p><p class="indent0">The waterdagger is in the Underwater_Cave.</p><p class="indent0">The waterdagger can be taken.</p><p class="indent0">The waterdagger unlocks the water dagger hole.</p><p class="indent0">After examining the waterdagger:</p><p class="indent1">say &quot;<span class="quote">Look on your map, that's the little thing called [</span><span class="substitution">Italic type</span><span class="quote">]Haleakala[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">].

Many have had the underwater map, but congratulations again, you are the first one to ever connect the dots and find the right way into this little and very complex underwater system. Do you see the light at the end of the tunnel? This is the heart of the volcano. If you reach it before a fire storm from Paia Cave coes - you will destroy every volcano on this planet and you can head back to your spaceship to leave the extincted area.</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Two options: </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Go [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]east[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] in order to head a volcanic cave called [</span><span class="substitution">Italic type</span><span class="quote">]Paia Cave[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">].

You can go back to the Landing Zone and try another way. In order to master the Kamehameha Route which only King Kamehameha passed a few hundred years ago you need some tools to get access to the Seaside. Be patient, calm and collected and make good choices. You would be the second one to master this way full of obstacles. You know you have to pass that massive rock, too. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">But be careful, check it out first. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Maybe it's a not a good idea - I don't know. </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]Examine the land mine.[</span><span class="substitution">Roman Type</span><span class="quote">]</span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">[</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]Take the land mine.[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] </span></p><p class="indent0"><span class="quote">Head [</span><span class="substitution">Bold type</span><span class="quote">]west[</span><span class="substitution">Roman type</span><span class="quote">] - back onto the Kamehameha Route or remain on the Field of Death - you won't make it very long until one of those land mines will detonate and kill you, so I'd recommend heading back to the trail.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">The description of Underwater_CaveHeart is &quot;<span class="quote">This is your last step to finally stop all the ash clouds and the constant lava flow above ground.

The Hokule'a boats tried to pass the shorebreaks and outer reef bombs but as you know, they have never been seen again. You can take a short break and watch the waves and breathe some clean ocean air - but I guess that's pretty much all you can do here... The windward side is the roughest. There are not many animals on this planet - to be honest, there are about six species living here. Five are not dangerous and only active at night, you won't see any of them. But the mountain lion only living on the windward west side of the planet is dangerous as it is very calm and collected. It's like the Great White Shark. Once you see it, it's too late. Please turn around, the east side is much more welcoming.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going nowhere from the Geysir_Area, say &quot;<span class="quote">The Geysir Area is the last thing you will see on the eastern side of the planet. Passing a few hundred Geysirs to just see the ocean behind them is not really promising I guess. Take your time and watch this beautiful water spectacle. You can always go back - but as you know the Kamehameha Walk from the Landing Zone over the North Shore to the Geysir Chambers is not the nicest way, always keep that in mind. But if you have no other way back to the spaceship, go for it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going nowhere from the Underwater_Cave, say &quot;<span class="quote">Try and find the heart of the Volcano or leave it, if you don't have any clue on how to get to the heart of the volcano. The map will help you but without the map you will not find the heart. I know it must be frustrating after the long journey but you better leave the Cave if you left the map in the spaceship - you save time, energy and you can return to the Geysir Chambers to fill up your bottles with fresh drinking water to make your way back on the Kamehameha trail. I hope you make it.</span>&quot;</p><p class="indent0">Instead of going nowhere from the Underwater_CaveHeart, say &quot;<span class="quote">You are in front of your exit to Frizza. Where else do you want to go?
